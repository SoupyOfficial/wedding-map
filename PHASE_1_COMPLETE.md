# Phase 1 Complete: Two-Stage OCR Implementation ‚úÖ

## What We've Accomplished

### ‚úÖ **Two-Stage OCR System Built**

**Stage 1: Raw Text Extraction**
- Extracts every visible character with basic formatting
- Preserves structural elements (line breaks, spacing, lists)
- Maintains contact information and pricing exactly as shown
- Uses GPT-4o with high-detail vision processing

**Stage 2: Intelligent Content Structuring**
- Transforms raw OCR into professional markdown
- Adds logical headers and section organization
- Formats contact information consistently  
- Creates proper tables for pricing/packages
- Uses markdown emphasis (**bold**, *italic*) appropriately

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced Processing Features**

1. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Detects and handles AI refusals gracefully
   - MPO file format support for iPhone photos

2. **Quality Metadata**
   - Processing method tracking in frontmatter
   - Stage completion indicators
   - Source file references

3. **Structured Output**
   - Professional markdown formatting
   - Consistent contact information layout
   - Logical content organization by category
   - Preserved pricing and terms information
