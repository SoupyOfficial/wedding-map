# Wedding Planning OCR Pipeline - Three-Phase Project Plan

## Project Overview

Transform wedding planning documents and research into a comprehensive, organized mind map through intelligent OCR processing, Pinterest data gathering, and consolidation.

---

## Phase 1: Enhanced Document Processing âœ… (Current Phase)

### 1.1 Two-Stage OCR Implementation

**Current Status:** In Development  
**Goal:** Process existing wedding planning photos with maximum formatting preservation and intelligent structuring

#### Stage 1: Raw Text Extraction
- **Purpose:** Extract every visible character with basic formatting
- **Model:** GPT-4o with high-detail vision processing
- **Focus:** Preserve line breaks, spacing, lists, headers
- **Output:** Raw text with structural elements intact

#### Stage 2: Intelligent Content Structuring  
- **Purpose:** Transform raw OCR into professional markdown
- **Model:** GPT-4o with specialized formatting instructions
- **Features:**
  - Logical section organization
  - Professional contact info formatting
  - Pricing tables and package structures
  - Enhanced readability with markdown
  - Category-based content grouping

#### Deliverables:
- [ ] Updated `ocr_batch.py` with two-stage processing
- [ ] Enhanced retry logic for failed images
- [ ] Structured output in `src/ocr_md_structured/`
- [ ] Comparison analysis vs single-stage OCR
- [ ] 94%+ success rate maintained

#### 2.1.2 Content Extraction Strategy
```python
pinterest_data_types = {
    "venue_pins": {
        "boards": ["Wedding Venues", "Reception Locations"],
        "extract": ["venue_name", "location", "pricing_hints", "capacity", "description", "website"]
    },
    "vendor_pins": {
        "boards": ["Wedding Vendors", "Photography", "Catering", "Flowers"],
        "extract": ["business_name", "contact_info", "services", "portfolio_links", "pricing"]
    },
    "inspiration_pins": {
        "boards": ["Wedding Ideas", "Decorations", "Themes"],
        "extract": ["concept", "style", "color_scheme", "budget_range", "diy_instructions"]
    },
    "timeline_pins": {
        "boards": ["Wedding Timeline", "Planning Checklist"],
        "extract": ["task", "deadline", "priority", "vendor_contact", "notes"]
    }
}
```

#### 2.1.3 Pinterest Processing Pipeline

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Mind Map Generation ðŸ§ 

### 3.1 Data Consolidation Engine

**Timeline:** After Phase 2 completion  
**Goal:** Merge OCR documents, Pinterest data, and additional research into unified mind map structure

#### 3.1.1 Multi-Source Data Integration
```python
data_sources = {
    "ocr_documents": "src/ocr_md_structured/",
    "pinterest_pins": "src/pinterest_data/", 
    "additional_research": "src/research_data/",
    "vendor_contacts": "src/contacts_consolidated/",
    "budget_tracking": "src/budget_analysis/"
}
```

#### 3.1.2 Intelligent Consolidation Process

**Step 1: Entity Recognition & Deduplication**
- Identify duplicate vendors across sources
- Merge contact information from multiple mentions
- Reconcile pricing data from different documents
- Standardize business names and contact formats

**Step 2: Relationship Mapping**
- Link venues to their vendor recommendations
- Connect services to pricing and availability
- Map timeline tasks to responsible vendors
- Associate style preferences with vendor capabilities

**Step 3: Priority & Decision Scoring**
- Weight information by source reliability
- Score vendors by multiple mentions/positive indicators
- Prioritize venues by saved pins + document mentions
- Identify decision-ready vs needs-more-research items

#### 3.1.3 Mind Map Structure Generation
